# Flask on Docker (Creating a Simple Web App)
Included in this repo is information to dockerize Flask with Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx. A comprehensive tutorial can be found [here](https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-flask-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/).     

## Overview
Using a modified Instagram tech stack, dockerizing Flask allows us to get a fully working web service. This was done by creating necessary files for a simple web app. To do this, Flask was configured to run on Docker with Postgres. In addition to this, Nginx and Gunicorn were added for production environments including the ability to serve static and user-uploaded media files (via Nginx).
